## Projects

* [Earth Note](https://earthnote.github.io): Some simple personal notes about Earth Science

* [GMT5_tutorials_sh](https://github.com/sean0921/GMT5_tutorials_sh) (Pending): I would like to learn GMT 5, but I HATE writing Batch scripts in Microsoft Windows environments, so I'm trying to use the shell script way to rewrite related examples.

* [docker-gipsy-centos7](https://github.com/sean0921/docker-gipsy-centos7): People like stable, even it is too OLD, so maybe docker is also a kind of work around solution.

* [dotfile](https://github.com/sean0921/dotfile): my personal childish configuration file under Unix-Like platform
